            <p class="sevents">A food festival is a festival, that uses food, often produce, as its central theme(attraction).
                 These festivals have always been a means of uniting communities through celebrations of harvests and
                 giving thanks for a plentiful growing season. Food festivals are quickly becoming part of a vast food
                 tourism industry. Food tourism itself has become an important part of the tourism industry,
                 and the presence of food festivals shown to support local industry development. Food tourism is also 
                 an important reason why people attend food festivals around the world. Studies have shown that engagement
                 with food tourism indicates that an individual will attend festivals again in the future, indicating a
                 cooperative element to food tourism and food festival attendance.</p>
